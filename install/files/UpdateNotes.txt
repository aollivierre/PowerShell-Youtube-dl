                                      Notes for version 2.0.3                                      
===================================================================================================

 1.  The '\scripts' folder has been removed, and the 'youtube-dl.ps1' file now sits in the
     root folder. BECAUSE OF THIS, IT'S RECOMMENDED THAT YOU DO A FULL REINSTALL OF THE SCRIPT.
     Doing a full reinstall will ensure that the shortcuts' paths are updated.

 2.  There are now two download archive files. The file 'DownloadVideoArchive.txt' stores
     the URL ID's of links that were downloaded using option '1  - Download video'. The file
     'DownloadAudioArchive.txt' stores the URL ID's of links that were downloaded using 
     option '2  - Download audio'.
	
 3.  Refactored some code involving installing and updating the script. If the script file is
     updated while the script is installed, the desktop and start menu shortcuts will be
     updated too. This should help updating in the future if file paths change again.

 4.  Any cache data downloaded from Youtube-dl will be stored in the new '\cache' folder.

 5.  The script now automatically checks for updates on startup. This can be toggled using
     the '$CheckForUpdates = ' script file setting.
